To say to Chris
- [ ] we won't be able to do a questionnaire at the end - outside scope
- [ ] is there any chance he can shorten up the words at all???
- [ ] can he reduce the number of options at all?
- [ ] talk him through the app, and talk him through the 'search' option
- [ ] tell him how far through the process we are (halfway basically)


Still to do?
 - [x] turn off all caps
 - [x] bigger free text input box
 - [x] links to home and sastrugi now work
 - [ ] check your answers screen? or Thanks for your submission?
 - [x] search results page
 - [ ] link to search results
 - [ ] enter key still needs to submit stuff
 - [ ] radio buttons should ALL by un-selected upon load.
 - [ ] simplify the html to the bare minimum, so I can add radio buttons in bulk
 
 - [ ] favicon

 - [ ] turn off the timeout functionality (Tom)
 - [ ] turn off the form validation? (Tom)
 - [ ] re-iterate the colours / fonts perhaps?
